# Ansura

**Snowflake x Capgemini Hackathon — Challenge 6: Unified Enterprise AI Agents Platform**
*AI-Powered Self-Service Analytics, Document Intelligence & Data Trust*

Ansura is a single conversational agent — built entirely on Snowflake Cortex —
that lets business users ask natural-language questions across three domains
without writing SQL, using a BI tool, or filing a ticket with a data team:

Tool names match the authoritative requirement doc ("Snowflake Cortex AI
Agents – Unified Business Enablement") word-for-word:

| Tool | Powered by | Answers questions like |
|---|---|---|
| **Self-Service Analytics Agent** | Cortex Analyst (semantic view) | "What's our average loss ratio by policy type?" |
| **Document Q&A Agent** | Cortex Search (RAG) | "What are the exclusion clauses for water damage in policy POL-1023?" |
| **Data Quality Agent** | Cortex Analyst (semantic view) | "Why did the DQ check on CUSTOMERS.EMAIL fail last week?" |

All three are exposed as **tools of one Cortex Agent** (`ENTERPRISE_AI_AGENT`),
which is the point of the "Unified" framing — one chat box, automatic routing
to whichever capability the question actually needs.

## About the name

**Ansura** is this solution's product name for the Snowflake x Capgemini
hackathon submission (Challenge 6). The underlying Snowflake objects keep
their descriptive identifiers (`ENTERPRISE_AI_AGENT`, `ENTERPRISE_AI_MCP_SERVER`,
etc.) — Ansura is the name to use in the submission, demo video, and any
outward-facing material.

## Repo structure

Files are numbered in the order you run them — each one is idempotent
(`CREATE OR REPLACE`), so re-running any of them is always safe.

```
semantic_model/
  01_create_semantic_view_analytics.sql   Agent 1 — structured data semantic view
sql/
  02_document_search_agent2.sql           Agent 2 — chunking + Cortex Search service
  03_dq_agent_enhancements.sql            DQ_COLUMN_HEALTH history + DQ_DOWNSTREAM_IMPACT lineage table (must run before 04 — its semantic view references both)
  04_data_quality_agent.sql               Agent 3 — DQ semantic view
  05_create_unified_agent.sql             Wires Agents 1 + 2 + 3 into ENTERPRISE_AI_AGENT

  07_create_mcp_server.sql                MCP Integration — exposes the agent as an MCP server
  08_unified_agent_observability.sql      Unified usage view (Streamlit + MCP) via native AI Observability
  util_reset_observability_baseline.sql   Optional — hides pre-existing test/demo traffic from the "Usage — all channels" counters; not part of setup

```

## Setup (run in order)

1. Confirm `INSURANCE_AI_HUB.ANALYTICS`, `.DOCUMENTS`, and `.DATA_QUALITY` tables
   are created and loaded (already done for this project).
2. Run `semantic_model/01_create_semantic_view_analytics.sql` in a Snowflake
   worksheet — creates `ANALYTICS_SEMANTIC_VIEW`.
3. Run `sql/02_document_search_agent2.sql` — chunks `POLICY_DOCUMENTS.CONTENT_TEXT`
   into `DOCUMENT_CHUNKS` and creates the `POLICY_DOCUMENT_SEARCH_SVC` Cortex
   Search service.
4. Run `sql/03_dq_agent_enhancements.sql`, then `sql/04_data_quality_agent.sql`
   — 03 backfills DQ_COLUMN_HEALTH history and creates DQ_DOWNSTREAM_IMPACT
   (needed for the "biggest score drop" / "downstream reporting impacted"
   questions), then 04 creates the DQ semantic view referencing both.
5. Run `sql/05_create_unified_agent.sql` — creates `ENTERPRISE_AI_AGENT` with
   all three tools wired up.
6. Run `sql/06_dashboards_and_agent_logging.sql` — creates the portfolio/risk,
   trend, and agent-accuracy views plus the `AGENT_INTERACTION_LOG` table the
   dashboard reads from.
7. Run `sql/07_create_mcp_server.sql` — creates `ENTERPRISE_AI_MCP_SERVER`
   (MCP Integration requirement).
8. Run `sql/08_unified_agent_observability.sql` — creates `VW_AGENT_OBSERVABILITY_CALLS`,
   `VW_AGENT_USAGE_ALL_CHANNELS`, and `VW_AGENT_CHANNEL_SPLIT`, which read Snowflake's
   native `SNOWFLAKE.LOCAL.GET_AI_OBSERVABILITY_EVENTS` so the dashboard can show usage
   from MCP callers too, not just Streamlit. The role running the Streamlit app needs
   `GRANT DATABASE ROLE SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX_USER` and `GRANT
   MONITOR ON AGENT ENTERPRISE_AI_AGENT` first (see comment at the top of that file).
9. In Snowsight: **Streamlit > + Streamlit App**, point it at `streamlit/app.py`
   (with `streamlit/pages/1_Dashboard.py` alongside it for the multipage
   dashboard) inside `INSURANCE_AI_HUB.PUBLIC`, attach `environment.yml`, and run.
   Also upload `streamlit/assets/ansura_avatar.png` and
   `streamlit/assets/ansura_sidebar_banner.png` into the app's `assets/`
   folder (via the file browser in the Snowsight Streamlit editor) — the
   chat UI uses these for the page icon, sidebar branding, and chat avatar,
   and falls back to a 🧠 emoji if they're missing. Ask it a few questions
   first so the dashboard's "Agent Accuracy & Usage" tab has data to show.

   **Note**: this app is Snowsight-managed (not git-integrated), so a code
   change in this repo does NOT automatically reach the deployed app — after
   pulling changes to `streamlit/app.py` or `streamlit/pages/1_Dashboard.py`,
   open the app in Snowsight and click **Edit** to paste in the updated file
   contents, or it'll keep running the old code.

## Judging criteria mapping

- **Innovation (30%)** — one unified agent auto-routing across structured SQL,
  unstructured RAG, and conversational data-quality root-cause analysis,
  rather than three separate bolt-on tools.
- **Technical Excellence (25%)** — native Snowflake `SEMANTIC VIEW` and
  `CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE` objects (no external vector DB or orchestration
  layer), automatic embedding generation, agent-level tool orchestration.
- **Business Value (25%)** — removes SQL/BI-tool dependency for business
  users; reduces time-to-answer for document lookups and DQ root-cause
  investigations from hours to seconds.
- **User Experience (20%)** — single chat interface, transparent generated
  SQL and document citations shown inline for trust/auditability, plus
  👍/👎 feedback that feeds the accuracy dashboard.

**Note on the challenge doc's technical requirements list**: the "Product
matching agent / Price optimization agent / Market intelligence agent /
Competitive pricing dashboard / Matching accuracy metrics" bullet points are
identical, word-for-word, across all six use cases in the hackathon doc —
they're retail-specific boilerplate that doesn't apply here (no product
catalog or competitor pricing exists in this schema). We implemented the
*category headings* (Cortex Agents, Snowflake Intelligence, MCP Integration)
against what this use case actually needs instead. See
`docs/REQUIREMENTS_MAPPING.md` for the full item-by-item mapping — worth
having ready if a judge asks about it.

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full write-up and `docs/DEMO_VIDEO_OUTLINE.md`
for the demo script.
